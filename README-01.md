# topic: machine learning-based malware detection

**머신러닝응용보안**

### **1. Understanding the Data**

The dataset is made up of disassembled code, broken down into:

- Training set: 1000 benign samples and 1000 malicious samples.
- Test set: 200 benign samples and 200 malicious samples.

It's possible that I'll need to convert this data into an image or vector.

### **2. Choosing the Model**

Considering my understanding of RNNs, CNNs, perceptrons, and linear regression, a perceptron or a simple neural network could be effective for binary code classification. If the data has a sequential pattern, an RNN could be more suitable.

Here are some model options:

1. **Perceptron / Simple Neural Network:**
    - **Pros:** Efficient, simple, and effective for binary classification on structured/tabular data.
    - **Cons:** May not capture sequential dependencies or patterns in the assembly code.
2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):**
    - **Pros:** Designed to handle sequential data, capable of capturing patterns over sequences of instructions.
    - **Cons:** More complex and computationally intensive. Requires careful tuning to avoid issues like vanishing/exploding gradients.
3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
    - **Pros:** Effective in recognizing spatial hierarchies and local patterns. Can be adapted to work with sequential data by treating sequences as 1D images.
    - **Cons:** Typically used for image data; might require careful preprocessing to adapt assembly code to a format suitable for CNNs.

### **3. Setting Up the Environment**

You will need libraries like **`numpy`** and **`pandas`** for data manipulation, **`tensorflow`** or **`pytorch`** for machine learning, and possibly **`sklearn`** for preprocessing.

I have a dataset called Disassembled

To create a binary classification algorithm for malware detection using machine learning, you can follow the steps below. We will implement a simple 

Python script that `loads the datasets, -→ preprocesses them,-→ trains a model, -→and evaluates` it on the test set. 

We'll use popular libraries like **`scikit-learn`** for the machine learning part and **`pandas`** for data handling.

### **2. Choosing the Model**

Given your learning of RNNs, CNNs, perceptrons, and linear regression, for binary classification of code (benign vs. malicious), a perceptron or a simple neural network can be effective due to their binary nature and efficiency in handling tabular or structured data. If your data has a sequential pattern (like in code lines), an RNN could be more suitable.
