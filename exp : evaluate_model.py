The `evaluate_model.py` script is designed to load trained machine learning models (`cnn_model.h5` and `rnn_model.h5`) and evaluate their performance on a test set of preprocessed assembly code data. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the script:

### Purpose of `evaluate_model.py`

The main objective of this script is to:

- Load the trained CNN and RNN models (`cnn_model.h5` and `rnn_model.h5`).
- Load the preprocessed test data (`X_test.npy`, `y_test.npy`) and tokenizer (`tokenizer.pickle`).
- Evaluate the performance of both models on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Output the evaluation metrics to assess the classification effectiveness of the models.

### Script Explanation

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**
    
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
    import pickle
    
    ```
    
    - **numpy**: For numerical operations and data storage.
    - **load_model**: From TensorFlow's Keras API, to load saved models (`cnn_model.h5`, `rnn_model.h5`).
    - **classification_report, confusion_matrix**: From scikit-learn, to generate classification metrics and confusion matrices.
2. **Load Preprocessed Data and Tokenizer**
    
    ```python
    # Load preprocessed data
    X_test = np.load('X_test.npy')
    y_test = np.load('y_test.npy')
    
    # Load tokenizer
    with open('tokenizer.pickle', 'rb') as handle:
        tokenizer = pickle.load(handle)
    
    ```
    
    - **Purpose**: Loads the preprocessed test data (`X_test.npy`, `y_test.npy`) as NumPy arrays and loads the tokenizer from `tokenizer.pickle` for converting text data into sequences of integers.
3. **Load Trained Models**
    
    ```python
    # Load CNN model
    cnn_model = load_model('cnn_model.h5')
    
    # Load RNN model
    rnn_model = load_model('rnn_model.h5')
    
    ```
    
    - **Purpose**: Loads the trained CNN and RNN models (`cnn_model.h5` and `rnn_model.h5`) that were previously saved after training in `train_model.py`.
4. **Evaluate CNN Model**
    
    ```python
    # Evaluate CNN model
    cnn_predictions = cnn_model.predict(X_test)
    cnn_predictions = np.round(cnn_predictions).flatten()
    
    cnn_report = classification_report(y_test, cnn_predictions)
    cnn_confusion = confusion_matrix(y_test, cnn_predictions)
    
    ```
    
    - **Purpose**: Evaluates the CNN model on the test data (`X_test`) and generates predictions (`cnn_predictions`). Converts predictions to binary (0 or 1) using rounding and flattening. Computes classification metrics (`cnn_report`) and confusion matrix (`cnn_confusion`) to assess model performance.
5. **Evaluate RNN Model**
    
    ```python
    # Evaluate RNN model
    rnn_predictions = rnn_model.predict(X_test)
    rnn_predictions = np.round(rnn_predictions).flatten()
    
    rnn_report = classification_report(y_test, rnn_predictions)
    rnn_confusion = confusion_matrix(y_test, rnn_predictions)
    
    ```
    
    - **Purpose**: Evaluates the RNN model on the same test data (`X_test`) and generates predictions (`rnn_predictions`). Similar to the CNN model, computes classification metrics (`rnn_report`) and confusion matrix (`rnn_confusion`) for performance evaluation.
6. **Output Evaluation Metrics**
    
    ```python
    # Output evaluation metrics
    print("CNN Model Evaluation:")
    print(cnn_report)
    print("Confusion Matrix:")
    print(cnn_confusion)
    print("\\n")
    
    print("RNN Model Evaluation:")
    print(rnn_report)
    print("Confusion Matrix:")
    print(rnn_confusion)
    
    ```
    
    - **Purpose**: Prints the evaluation results for both models, including classification reports (which include precision, recall, F1-score, and support for both classes) and confusion matrices (which summarize predictions against actual labels).

### Summary

The `evaluate_model.py` script provides a structured approach to evaluating the performance of trained CNN and RNN models on preprocessed assembly code data. By analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, you can assess how well the models classify assembly code into benign and malware categories. This evaluation process is crucial for validating the effectiveness of the models and understanding their capabilities in real-world applications, such as cybersecurity and threat detection. Adjustments to evaluation methods or metrics can be made based on specific project requirements or model performance insights gained during development.
